Say you have a card with values and then valjes are passed to app
You have to display card value as username
function Chef() {
  const food = "Pizza"; // Data the Customer needs
  return <Waiter food={food} />;
}

function Waiter({ food }) {
  // Waiter doesn't use 'food' but passes it to Customer
  return <Customer food={food} />;
}

function Customer({ food }) {
  // Customer consumes 'food'
  return <h1>Enjoy your {food}!</h1>;
}

In my project: Main -> UserPage->Orders->OrderContainer

ie we try to make a global file to directly pass values to order OrderContainer
Context API react ka kaam hai
Redux: can be used instead of Context but it is external library

How to use

Context folder in src -> UserContext.js file
UserContext is to be added on top level
<UserContext>
<Login>
<Card>
<Data>
<Card/>
..
<UserContext>


after that in your component after doing the neccesary sh*t
const {setUser} = useContext(UserContext)
this setUser will change the user of UserContextProvider.jsx
user and setUser are objects so use them like {user} and {setUser}
